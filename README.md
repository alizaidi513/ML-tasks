üß† Machine Learning Projects Portfolio ‚Äì Classification, Regression & EDA
This repository presents five beginner-to-intermediate level machine learning tasks that involve exploring real-world datasets, building predictive models, and generating business insights using Python. Each task demonstrates a key concept in supervised machine learning and data visualization.

üìÅ Contents
Task	Description	Model Type	Dataset
Task 1	Visualize and understand the Iris dataset	EDA	Iris
Task 2	Predict loan default risk	Classification	Loan Prediction
Task 3	Identify churn-prone bank customers	Classification	Churn Modelling
Task 4	Predict medical insurance charges	Regression	Medical Cost
Task 5	Predict who accepts personal loans	Classification	Bank Marketing

‚úÖ Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
Objective: Understand dataset structure and create simple visualizations using the Iris dataset.

Dataset: Iris (from seaborn or CSV)

Steps:

Load and inspect data with .head(), .shape, .columns

Scatter plots to visualize variable relationships

Histograms and box plots to analyze distributions and outliers

Skills:

Pandas data handling

Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

‚úÖ Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
Objective: Predict whether a loan applicant will default using customer data.

Dataset: Loan Prediction Dataset (from Kaggle)

Steps:

Handle missing data (e.g., imputation or removal)

Visualize education, loan amount, and income

Train Logistic Regression or Decision Tree

Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix

Skills:

Data cleaning

EDA

Binary classification

Model evaluation

‚úÖ Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)
Objective: Identify customers likely to leave a bank.

Dataset: Churn Modelling Dataset

Steps:

Encode categorical features (Geography, Gender)

Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest or Logistic Regression)

Use feature importance to explain churn drivers

Skills:

Label/One-Hot Encoding

Supervised classification

Feature interpretation

‚úÖ Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
Objective: Estimate medical insurance claim amounts based on personal features.

Dataset: Medical Cost Personal Dataset

Steps:

Train a Linear Regression model to predict charges

Visualize the impact of BMI, age, and smoking status

Evaluate using MAE and RMSE

Skills:

Regression modeling

Correlation visualization

Error metrics: MAE, RMSE

‚úÖ Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
Objective: Predict which bank customers are most likely to accept a personal loan.

Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI ML Repository)

Steps:

Explore demographics: age, job, marital status

Train Logistic Regression or Decision Tree

Identify customer segments based on model insights

Skills:

Data exploration

Classification modeling

Business insight extraction
