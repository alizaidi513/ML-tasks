üß† Machine Learning Projects Portfolio ‚Äì Classification, Regression & EDA
This repository includes five supervised machine learning projects covering real-world tasks such as predicting credit risk, insurance claims, personal loan acceptance, and more. Each task includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, and interpretation using Python.

üîç Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset
Objective:
Understand how to load, summarize, and visualize a dataset.

Dataset:
Iris Dataset (available via Seaborn or CSV)

Instructions:

Load data using Pandas

Use .shape, .columns, .head() to inspect structure

Create:

Scatter plots for variable relationships

Histograms for distribution

Box plots for outlier detection

Skills:

Data loading and inspection

Summary statistics

Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn

üí≥ Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
Objective:
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

Dataset:
Loan Prediction Dataset (available on Kaggle)

Instructions:

Handle missing data

Visualize key features (loan amount, education, income)

Train classification models (Logistic Regression / Decision Tree)

Evaluate using accuracy and confusion matrix

Skills:

Data cleaning and imputation

EDA and visual analysis

Binary classification

Model evaluation

üìâ Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)
Objective:
Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank.

Dataset:
Churn Modelling Dataset

Instructions:

Clean and prepare data

Encode categorical features (e.g., geography, gender)

Train classification model

Analyze feature importance to explain churn

Skills:

Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding

Classification modeling

Model interpretation using feature importance

üè• Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
Objective:
Estimate medical insurance charges based on personal data.

Dataset:
Medical Cost Personal Dataset

Instructions:

Train a Linear Regression model

Visualize the effect of BMI, age, and smoking status

Evaluate model performance using MAE and RMSE

Skills:

Regression modeling

Feature correlation and visualization

Error evaluation (MAE, RMSE)

üè¶ Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
Objective:
Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.

Dataset:
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Instructions:

Perform EDA on age, job, marital status

Train a Logistic Regression or Decision Tree classifier

Analyze customer segments more likely to accept the offer

Skills:

Exploratory data analysis

Classification modeling

Business insight extraction from model results
